# 🧠 How to Train Your Assistant

To make Lucia (your assistant) smarter and ensure she answers correctly, she needs to be "fed" with the right information. Here is how you can do it easily.

## 🏘️ 1. Teaching Her About Your Properties
The assistant doesn't know which houses you have for sale until you tell her. The more details you provide, the more convincing she will be with customers.

1.  **Use the Spreadsheet (CSV)**: We have prepared a file where you can list your properties.
2.  **Write Rich Descriptions**: Don't just write "3-room apartment". Write: *"Bright three-room apartment on the third floor with elevator, recently renovated, near the subway"*.
3.  **The Result**: When a customer asks, "Do you have any bright houses?", Lucia will know exactly what to propose.

## 🏢 2. Teaching Her Your Rules (Knowledge Base)
Do you want the assistant to know your hours or how you work?

- **Office Hours**: Tell us your hours, and Lucia will tell customers when you are available for a call.
- **Special Services**: If you offer free valuations or mortgage advice, including this in the info allows Lucia to promote these services during the chat.

## 🎯 3. How to Make Her "Smarter"?
Artificial Intelligence works by reading the documents you provide. If you notice Lucia makes a mistake:

1.  **Check the Data**: Often the error comes from an incomplete description in the property file.
2.  **Add the Missing Detail**: If a customer asks if a building has a doorman and Lucia doesn't know, add "doorman present" to the property description.
3.  **Instant Update**: Once the file is saved and updated, Lucia instantly learns the new information.

## 💡 Pro Tip
When describing a house, imagine you are talking to a colleague who has to sell it for you. If you give Lucia all the "tools" (information), she will do the hard work of qualifying for you, bringing you only customers ready to sign.
