# 🎭 Agency Personality Guide

Your digital assistant, Lucia, is not just a machine: she is the voice of your agency. Here is how you can define her "personality" so it best reflects your brand.

---

## 🌟 1. Choose Your Style
How do you want Lucia to address customers?
- **Classic and Prestigious**: "Good morning, I am the digital assistant for [Agency Name]. How may I help you with your search?" (Formal tone).
- **Modern and Dynamic**: "Hi! I'm the assistant at [Agency Name]. I see you're looking for a home; how can I help you out?" (Informal tone).
- **Friendly and Family-Oriented**: "Welcome to our family! I'm here to make your home search as simple as possible."

## 📝 2. Tell Your Story
In the Knowledge Base file (general information), add details about your history:
- *"We are a historic agency founded in 1980, specializing in luxury penthouses."*
- *"We are a young team using technology to find the perfect home in less than 30 days."*
Lucia will use this information to build trust with the customer during the conversation.

## 🏠 3. Values and Specializations
If your agency has specific strengths, Lucia should shout them (politely)!
- **Example**: If you offer free valuations in 24 hours, make sure to include that. Lucia will say: *"Did you know our experts can value your home in just 24 hours? Would you like to hear more about it?"*

## 💡 How to check the result?
Give it a try! Message the agency's WhatsApp number as if you were a customer.
- If she seems too cold, add warmer words to the information.
- If she seems too informal, ask us to set the "Formal" tone as the default.
