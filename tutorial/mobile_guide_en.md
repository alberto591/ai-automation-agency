# 📱 Mobile App Guide

Your agency is always with you. Here is how to use the smartphone application to manage customers wherever you are.

---

## 🔒 1. Secure Access (Biometrics)
The app protects your agency's data with maximum security.
- **ID Check**: When you open the app, it will ask you to scan your face (FaceID) or place your finger (Fingerprint).
- **Why?**: This ensures that only you can read customer messages, even if you lose your phone. It's the same system used by banks.

## 📋 2. The Customer List
On the main screen, you will find a list of names, just like on the computer.
- **Everything at Hand**: Click on a name to see their details or the messages they exchanged with the assistant.
- **Colors**: The colors are the same as on the website (Green for new ones, Blue for those ready to buy).

## 💬 3. Chatting on the Go
Are you out for a viewing and want to reply to a customer?
1. Open the customer's chat.
2. Read what Lucia (the assistant) has written.
3. If you want to talk yourself, just type! Remember that if you want Lucia to stop intervening, you must click on "Take Control".

## 🔔 4. Never Miss an Opportunity
Make sure your **notifications** are enabled. You will receive an alert on your phone every time a "hot" lead (in Blue) has finished talking to the assistant and is ready for you.
