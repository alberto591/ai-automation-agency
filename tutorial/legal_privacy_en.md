# ⚖️ Simplified Legal and Privacy Guide

Managing customer data is a significant responsibility. Here is how our system helps you follow the rules (GDPR) in a simple and professional way.

## 🛡️ 1. Where is the data?
All information collected by the assistant (names, phone numbers, budgets) is saved in a secure "digital vault" (Supabase).
- **Protection**: Data is encrypted, meaning no one can read it without authorization.
- **Ownership**: The data belongs exclusively to your agency. We do not sell or use it for any other purpose.

## 📝 2. What to tell customers?
To be perfectly compliant, we recommend following these small steps:
- **Privacy Policy**: Ensure your website states that you use automation systems to manage contacts.
- **Transparency**: The assistant always introduces itself as a "Digital Assistant." This is important because the customer must know they are talking to an AI.

## 🔐 3. Security for the Agent
You are the guardian of the vault.
- **Passwords**: Never share your Dashboard password.
- **Mobile Access**: The app uses your face or fingerprint precisely to prevent anyone from accessing your customer data if your phone is stolen.

## 🏛️ 4. Digital Compliance
Our system is designed to be a "Digital Law Firm":
- **Deletion**: If a customer asks to be removed, you can do it with one click from the Dashboard, and their data will disappear from all records.
- **Records**: We keep track of when each customer consented to be contacted on WhatsApp.
