We have collected answers to the most common questions here to help you use the system with confidence.

### 🛡️ Safety and Privacy

**Is my data safe?**
Yes. We use a "digital vault" (called Supabase) that protects your customers' information according to European privacy laws (GDPR). No one outside your agency can see them.

**Can the assistant say the wrong thing?**
The assistant is trained only with the information we provide about your properties. If a customer asks a question it cannot answer, the assistant will politely ask them to wait for your intervention.

### 📱 Daily Operations

**What happens if my phone is off?**
Don't worry! The assistant works independently of your phone. When you turn your device back on and log in to the website, you will find all the new messages ready for you.

**Do I need to use a new phone number?**
No, the system uses a dedicated number for the assistant. Customers will write to that number, and you will see everything in your control panel on your computer.

**Does the assistant work on Sundays?**
Yes, the assistant is active 24/7. It responds even on holidays like Christmas or mid-August!

### 🤝 Managing Customers

**How do I know when a customer is important?**
In your control panel, names change color. When you see a name in **Blue**, it means the customer has answered all the initial questions (budget, area, etc.) and is ready to talk to you.

**Can I stop the assistant if I want to talk myself?**
Of course! There is a button called **"Take Control"**. As soon as you click it, the assistant stops, and you can continue the conversation as you would on a normal WhatsApp.

**What if a customer gets angry or doesn't understand?**
If the assistant detects that the customer is confused or frustrated, it will stop responding and send you an urgent notification asking you to step in.

### 💻 Technical Support

**What if I press the wrong button?**
Don't worry, you can't accidentally delete anything. The system tracks everything. If you're unsure, just refresh the page and everything will return to normal.

**Do I need a powerful computer?**
No, any computer, tablet, or smartphone with an internet connection will work. It even runs well on older models.
