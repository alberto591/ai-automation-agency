# 🏠 Simple Guide: Your New Digital Assistant

Welcome! This guide will help you understand how your new Anzevino AI system works. We have designed everything to be as simple as possible—like using a TV remote or WhatsApp.

## 🌟 1. What is this system?
Think of this system as a **tireless digital secretary**.
- It never sleeps.
- It responds to clients in seconds.
- It only alerts you when someone is truly interested.

## 📱 2. How do customers find you? (The Customer Journey)
Instead of calling you on the phone while you are driving or at lunch, this is what happens:

1. **The Customer sees an ad**: On Immobiliare.it or local portals.
2. **They send a message**: Instead of an email you might miss, the system receives their details.
3. **The Assistant "Lucia" responds**: Within 15 seconds, Lucia sends a friendly **WhatsApp** message to the customer.
4. **Lucia asks the right questions**: She asks about their budget, preferred area, and when they want to see the property.

## 💻 3. Your Control Panel (The Dashboard)
To see what's happening, you will use your computer or tablet. You will see a list of names.

- **Names in Green**: New people currently talking to Lucia.
- **Names in Blue**: People who have already answered all the questions.
- **The Message Icon**: Click it to read the entire conversation. It’s just like reading WhatsApp on your phone!

## 🤝 4. When is it your turn? (Taking Control)
Lucia is good, but you are the professional. If you see that a customer is ready to buy or has a difficult question:

1. **The Magic Button**: In the panel, you will see a button called **"Take Control" (Takeover)**.
2. **What happens**: If you click it, Lucia steps aside and stops responding.
3. **Now you talk**: From that moment on, the messages you type go directly to the customer. Lucia won't intervene again unless you ask her to.

## ❓ 5. Simple Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Do I need to install anything on my phone?**
A: No! You will receive notifications and can see everything from the website address we provided.

**Q: What if I lose my internet connection?**
A: Don't worry. Lucia keeps working for you in the "cloud" (a secure digital vault). When you go back online, everything will be ready.

**Q: I'm afraid of clicking the wrong buttons.**
A: You can't break anything! The system saves everything automatically. If you're unsure, look at the colors of the names: they always tell you who needs attention.
