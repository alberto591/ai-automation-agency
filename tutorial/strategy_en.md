# 📈 Agency Strategy: Winning with AI

Artificial Intelligence is not just a technical tool; it is your competitive advantage. Here is how to use it to close more deals and work fewer hours.

## 🎯 1. Know the Customer Before You Call
One of the biggest advantages is that Lucia (the assistant) asks the "uncomfortable" questions for you.
- **Look at the Budget**: Before calling, you already know how much the customer wants to spend. If they have a high budget, be ready with premium alternatives.
- **Analyze the Areas**: If the customer asks for areas different from the ad, you might have the perfect house for them in your portfolio that they haven't seen yet.

## 🔥 2. Prioritize "Blue" Leads
Time is money. In your panel:
- **Blue Leads**: They have answered everything. They are ready. Call them within 1 hour of the end of their conversation with Lucia for maximum impact.
- **Green Leads**: They are still in the discovery phase. Let Lucia do her job until they turn Blue.

## 🤝 3. The Perfect Moment for "Takeover"
When should you step in?
- **Technical Questions**: If the customer asks about a specific mortgage or a complex legal clause, click "Take Control" and answer yourself. Show immediate professionalism.
- **Closing**: When the customer says, "Yes, I want to see the house," step in to set the appointment. The human touch at the end is crucial for building trust.

## 📊 4. Improve Your Portfolio
If you notice many customers asking for houses in an area where you have nothing, use the AI as market research. It's telling you what the market wants right now!
