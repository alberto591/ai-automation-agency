# 🛠️ What to do if...? (Troubleshooting Guide)

Don't worry if something doesn't seem to be working. Most problems can be solved with a few clicks. Here is our checklist:

---

### 🌐 1. The site or app won't load
- **Check your connection**: Make sure your Wi-Fi or mobile data is on. Try loading another site (e.g., Google).
- **Refresh the page**: Click the round arrow ⟳ at the top of your browser.
- **Close and reopen**: Close the app or browser and try logging in again.

### 💬 2. A customer says they haven't received a response
- **Wait a moment**: Sometimes WhatsApp takes a few extra seconds.
- **Check the Data**: Ensure the customer's phone number is correct.
- **Assistant Status**: Look at your control panel. If you see that Lucia isn't responding, check if you accidentally enabled the "Take Control" button.

### 🔑 3. I can't log in (Access Issues)
- **Check capitalization**: Make sure your Caps Lock key isn't on.
- **Biometrics**: On the app, if your face or fingerprint isn't recognized, clean the camera or sensor and try again.

### 🏘️ 4. The new house isn't appearing
- **File Update**: Make sure you have saved the property CSV file on your computer.
- **Waiting time**: The system might take a minute to "read" the new information you added.
