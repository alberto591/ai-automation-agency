# 🌟 Agency AI: Partner Pitch & Live Demo Guide

This document is your toolkit for presenting the **Agency CRM & AI Lead Manager** to potential real estate agency owners.

## 🎯 1. The Value Proposition (The "Why")

Real estate agents waste **60-80% of their time** qualifying cold leads from portals (Immobiliare, Idealista).
**The Solution**: An AI that instantly captures, profiles, and engages leads on WhatsApp 24/7, while the agent only steps in for high-value negotiations.

| Metric | Traditional Agent | AI-Powered Agency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Response Time** | 2-4 Hours (Average) | **< 10 Seconds** |
| **Availability** | Working Hours only | **24/7/365** |
| **Qualification** | Manual Call / Email | **Automated Profiling** (Budget, Zone, Intent) |
| **Lead Capture** | Easy to miss / forget | **100% Persistence** in Supabase CRM |

## 🚀 2. The "Partner Wow" Live Demo Script

Follow these steps to conduct a professional demo using the included simulation scripts.

### Step 1: Pre-Show
1.  Open the **Dashboard** at `http://localhost:5173/`.
2.  Open your **Terminal**.
3.  Say: *"Imagine a lead just came in from Immobiliare.it while you were having dinner..."*

### Step 2: Inbound Automation
1.  Run the demo script:
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/live_demo.py
    ```
2.  Select **Scenario 1 (Luxury Seeker)**.
3.  **Point to the Dashboard**: *"Look at how the inbox updates instantly. The AI just extracted a 2.5M budget and preferred zones without us lifting a finger."*

### Step 3: Real-Time Intelligence
1.  Open the **Lead Info Drawer** (Click the 'i' icon).
2.  Say: *"We have the budget, the zone, and a summary. The agent already knows this is a VIP client before the first manual message."*

### Step 4: The Handover (The Wow Factor)
1.  Show the **AI Toggle**: *"If the client starts negotiating 1-on-1, I flip this switch. The AI stops, and I take over. The client never feels handled by a 'dumb' bot."*
2.  Send a **Manual Message**: *"See? Real-time sync. High-touch service, low-effort management."*
