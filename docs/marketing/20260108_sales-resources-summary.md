## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Calls:
1. **Have Cheat Sheet visible** - Don't memorize, reference it!
2. **Listen 60%, talk 40%** - Let them tell you their pain
3. **Use their numbers** - Ask for their lead volume, calculate THEIR ROI
4. **Pause after questions** - Don't rush, let them think
5. **Always schedule next step** - Never end without follow-up date

### For Emails:
1. **Subject line = hook** - "Lost €9k/month in night leads?"
2. **Embed Slide 2 + 4** - Visual = 2x higher engagement
3. **One clear CTA** - Book demo OR start trial (not both)
4. **Keep under 150 words** - Busy people skim
5. **Follow up Day 3** - Most deals close on 2nd-3rd touch

### For Demos:
1. **Start with discovery** - "What made you book this demo?"
2. **Spend 60% on ROI slide** - This is what closes deals
3. **Show product live** - Don't just talk about it
4. **Recommend specific plan** - "I'd suggest Professional for you"
5. **Ask for the sale** - "Shall we start with the pilot?"
