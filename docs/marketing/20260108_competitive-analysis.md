## Detailed Competitor Profiles

### Tier 1: Direct Competitors (Similar Offering)

#### Waliner (Italy/India)
**What:** WhatsApp automation platform with real estate templates

**Pricing:** €25-100/month

**Strengths:**
- Very low price point captures price-sensitive buyers
- Strong WhatsApp Business API integration
- Real estate message templates pre-built

- Integrated AVM delivers valuations in 2 minutes
- Lead scoring with HOT/WARM/COLD
- Intelligence dashboard

**Battle Card:**
> "Waliner is good for basic WhatsApp automation, but it's scripted - it can only follow pre-written flows. FiFi understands context, generates property valuations, and scores your leads. For €6/day more, you get 10x the capability."

## Competitive Battle Cards (For Sales)

### vs. "We already have a CRM"
> "Great! FiFi isn't a CRM - it's your 24/7 WhatsApp assistant that FEEDS your CRM qualified leads. Think of us as the front desk that never sleeps. We integrate with your existing system."

### vs. "We're looking at Lofty/BoomTown"
> "Those are excellent platforms - for US brokerages with €2,000+/month budgets. They don't support WhatsApp, which is 95% of your leads in Italy. FiFi is built for the Italian market, costs 80% less, and includes property valuations they don't have."

### vs. "We're considering Waliner"
> "Waliner is solid for basic WhatsApp automation at €50/month. The difference: they use scripted chatbots - fixed question trees. FiFi uses real AI that understands context, generates instant property valuations, and learns from every conversation. It's €150/month more for 10x the capability."

### vs. "We want predictive seller leads"
> "SmartZip is the leader there - at €500+/month for a single feature. Right now, we focus on maximizing your existing lead conversion with AI. Predictive sellers is on our 2026 roadmap. In the meantime, let's make sure you're not losing the leads you already have."

### vs. "AI will never replace human agents"
> "100% agree! FiFi doesn't replace agents - it replaces the 2am wake-up call. Your AI handles the 'What's the price? What's the location? When can I visit?' questions at 11pm. Your agents handle the viewings, negotiations, and closings. More time for high-value work."
